# My Personal Website
Welcome to my personal website's repository. I am going for a clean and simple
look. This was inspired by a minimal portfolio I saw a couple months ago.
If you have any suggestions or encounter any problems, feel free
to open an issue.

### Website Content
These are some short-term goals for the website.
- [ ] home
  - [x] navbar
  - [x] avatar
  - [x] about
  - [ ] contact
  - [x] background
- [ ] projects
  - [x] navbar
  - [ ] introduction
  - [ ] project listing
- [ ] resume
  - [ ] update resume
  - [ ] upload resume

### Performance Optimization
These are just a couple of nitpicky things I want to do to improve performance. The website is already light as it is, but why not make it lighter?
- [ ] minify html
- [x] minify css
- [ ] optimize .png images
